# Introduction

6.5060/6.827 Algorithms Engineering
## Prerequisites

This is a graduate-level course where we will cover research in algorithm engineering. Advanced undergraduates may enroll if they have taken 6.122 (6.046) and 6.106 (6.172)

## Course Description

This is a research-oriented course on algorithm engineering, which will cover both the theory and practice of algorithms and data structures. Students will learn about models of computation, algorithm design and analysis, and performance engineering of algorithm implementations. We will study the design and implementation of sequential, parallel, cache-efficient, external-memory, and write-efficient algorithms for fundamental problems in computing. Many of the principles of algorithm engineering will be illustrated in the context of parallel algorithms and graph problems. Students will read and present research papers, write paper reviews, complete problem sets, participate in classroom discussions, and complete a semester-long research project. Class time will consist of lectures, student presentations, and group project meetings. This course is suitable for graduate students or advanced undergraduates who have taken 6.122 (6.046) and 6.106 (6.172). Mathematical maturity and familiarity with algorithm analysis and performance engineering will be assumed. Lectures will consist of instructor and student presentations. Lecture attendance is required and participation counts toward the grade.
